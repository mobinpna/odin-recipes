    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you ask Persians about their favorite dish, you will undoubtedly hear gheymeh among the answers several times! This Beef and Split Pea Stew is one of the most popular Persian foods and has been a traditional meal since hundreds of years ago. </p>
        <p>The word “gheymeh” represents the way meat is cut into small pieces for this stew, despite other kinds of Persian stews like ghormeh sabzi with larger pieces of meat. </p>
        <p>Khoresh gheymeh is widely served in the Islamic holy months, especially Ramadan and Muharram. These kinds of foods are called “Nazri” (meaning free food) and are usually so flavorful and popular.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 gr lamb leg, cubed</li>
        <li>250 gr yellow split peas</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized onions, diced</li>
        <li>5 dried limes</li>
        <li>2 large-sized potatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Bloomed saffron</li>
        <li>2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, wash split peas thoroughly and soak them in cold water for 2 hours. Remember to change the water every 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the diced onions, cubed lamb, turmeric powder, and salt. Saute them until the meat gets brown.</li>
        <li>Then add split peas to the pot and saute them until their colors start to change.</li><li>Now it is time for tomato paste. Add tomato paste and black pepper, and roast them until the paste is not raw anymore.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups of water, cover the pot, reduce the heat and let it cook for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make some holes in the dried limes using a fork or knife. Put them in a bowl of water for 1 hour. This can help limes not to taste bitter in gheymeh.</li>
        <li>After 1 hour, add dried limes to the stew and let them cook for 30 minutes. Finally, add bloomed saffron. It gives a great taste, smell, and color to our gheymeh stew.</li>
        <li>When the stew is cooking, peel and slice the potatoes. Place them in a colander and rinse under cold water. Dry them with a paper towel before frying.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add salt to the oil. Then gently add the potatoes and fry them in a single layer for 15-20 minutes. Do not forget to stir and turn them so they will not burn and will become tender and golden. When you are done with frying, transfer the fried potatoes to a platter covered with a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.</li>
        <li>At this time, the stew is also ready, and you can enjoy this hearty dish of gheymeh!</li>
