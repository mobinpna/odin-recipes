    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Zereshk Polo ba Morgh is a Persian classic made with Zereshk (barberries), Morgh (chicken), and Polo, which is the steamed and fluffy Persian rice. This is one of the mixed rice dishes that you will find at small casual get togethers, as well as larger Persian dinner parties, weddings and most festive celebrations and holidays. Sometimes this dish is served side by side with a type of soup, usually Soup é Morgh é Zaferani, or Soup é Jo and a simple salad.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 skinless chicken thighs, or drumsticks (about 3 pounds)</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li=>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>¾ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large onion cut in half</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Fry chicken pieces in oil until golden.</li>
        <li>Wash the barberries in warm water, drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Put the chicken pieces in the pot. Add chopped onion into a saucepan and saute it in oil until it is soft. Then add tomato paste, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and stir for a few minutes.&nbsp;Pour the mixture on the chicken and add 2 cups of water and cover the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil and skim off any foam on the surface and allow the chicken pieces to cook with gentle heat for about 2 hours. 10 minutes before you turn off the heat, pour 2 teaspoons of bloomed saffron onto the chicken.</li>
        <li>The sauce for this recipe should be thick.&nbsp;If the sauce is too thin, remove the chicken pieces from the pot and boil the sauce until thick.</li>
        <li>Rinse rice until the water went clear. Place rice in a large pan filled with water. Add some salt and let it cook. The rice is done after 6 to 8 minutes when it begins to rise to the top and the water comes back to a boil. Check the rice is cooked at the end by trying a grain.</li>
        <li>Break one grain in half. Rice should be soft on the outside but hard in the middle. Pour rice into the colander to drain; then set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot heat 2 tablespoons of oil or butter. Arrange potato slices or Lavash naan.&nbsp; Pour&nbsp;the rice back into the pot.</li>
        <li>Place the pot on medium-high heat directly on the stovetop.&nbsp;Cover the pot and cook until rice begins to steam. Then lower the heat and cook for one hour until the crust forms.</li>
        <li>Put 2 tablespoons of butter or vegetable oil in a small frying pan on medium heat. Add barberries to the pan and saute for 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take 5 or 6 tablespoons of cooked rice and mix it with 2 teaspoons of bloomed saffron and set aside.</li>
        <li>Serve Persian rice on a plate and top it with saffron rice and barberries. Put chicken pieces on a plate and serve it with rice.</li>
        <li>Serve the zereshk polo sauce in a small bowl.</li>
